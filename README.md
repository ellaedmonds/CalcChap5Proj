Q2 Mr. Donnelly Calc Project Katie and Ella

USER MANUEL:

Insert your equation in python format in the first input bubble
  Equations that can be handled:
   - Quadratics, all in format: x3 = (x**3) and (x+2)**2 must be writen as (x**2)+(4*x)+4
   - Basic Trig, only: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x)
   - Logarithmic, only: e, log, log10, log2
   - Other usable math tools: sqrt, pi, exp, expm1

*****In addition for log and square root functions the interval you select must be in the domain of the function, the program will remind you of this.*****

Insert the starting point and then the end point of the interval for which you would like to analyze the function (note that the longer the interval, the longer the analyzation process will take)

ISSUES REMAINING: 
Unfortunately, our program has an issue running 1/x functions due to python’s difficulty in dealing with asymptotes. However, the program will still graph the function and its derivatives as well as giving some maxs and mins. We worked really hard to fix this, but ran into many issues, and didn’t want to sacrifice the program’s ability to graph so many other functions in order to fix it.
