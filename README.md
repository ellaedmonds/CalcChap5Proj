Q2 Mr. Donnelly Calc Project Katie and Ella

USER MANUEL:

Insert your equation in python format in the first input bubble
  Equations that can be handled:
   - Quadratics, all in format: x3 = (x**3)
   - Basic Trig, only: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x)
   - Logarithmic, only: e, log, log10, log2
   - Other usable math tools: sqrt, pi, exp, expm1

Insert the starting point and then the end point of the interval for which you would like to analyze the function (the longer the interval the longer the process will take)
